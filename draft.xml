      <t>This specification defines mechanisms for dynamically associating
        authenticators with resource owners.  Once associated, an authenticator
        can be used for strong authorization within OAuth 2.0.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        In order for an OAuth 2.0 authorization server to enforce strong
        authorization, it must associate resource owners with one or more
        authenticators capable of responding to a strong authorization
        challenge.  This specification describes how an authenticator can be
        dynamically associated with a resource owner to obtain this information.

    <section title="Authenticator Associate Endpoint">
      <t>
        The authenticator associate endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 endpoint defined in
        this document that is designed to allow an authenticator to be
        associated with a resource owner.  The authenticator associate endpoint
        MUST accept HTTP POST messages with request parameters encoded in the
        entity body using the "application/json" format.  The authenticator
        associate endpoint MUST be protected by a transport-layer security
        mechanism.
      </t>
      <t>
        The authenticator associate endpoint MUST be an OAuth 2.0 protected
        resource and it MUST accept access tokens as defined by <xref target='RFC6750'/>
        to limit association to only previously authorized parties.  The method
        by which the access token is obtained by the client is generally out of
        band; two such mechanisms are defined by this specification.  The method
        by which the access token is verified and validated by the authenticator
        associate endpoint is out of scope for this specification.
